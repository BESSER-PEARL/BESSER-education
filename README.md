# BESSER Education: Hands-On Guides and Exercises

Welcome to BESSER Education!
This repository provides laboratory guides and exercises to help you explore and master the [BESSER low-code framework (BLC)](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER.git) and the [BESSER Agentic Framework (BAF)](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER-Agentic-Framework). Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, these resources are designed to deepen your understanding and enhance your practical skills with BESSER.


## ðŸ”¬ Laboratory Guides Overview

Each lab guide focuses on a specific aspect of the BESSER ecosystem, offering hands-on experience with modeling, code generation, and agent-based systems. Hereâ€™s what each lab includes:

1. Lab 1 â€“ BESSER Basics

    - Learn the fundamentals of the BESSER Low-Code platform (BLC).
    - Get familiar with the web-based modeling environment.
    - Create and validate your first class diagram.
    - Learn how to use the code generators.

2. Lab 2 â€“ Developing Code Generators

    - Explore how to define model-to-text transformations.
    - Implement simple code generators using Python.
    - Generate code from class diagrams and understand basic transformation rules.

3. Lab 3 â€“ Metamodeling and Advanced Generators

    - Dive into metamodeling to define your own modeling languages.
    - Extend the BESSER metamodel to support new concepts.
    - Build and reuse code generation templates for complex models.

4. Lab 4 â€“ Agent-Based Modeling with BAF

    - Get started with the BESSER Agentic Framework (BAF).
    - Learn how to model agent behaviors and interactions.
    - Simulate intelligent agents based on event-driven logic.
